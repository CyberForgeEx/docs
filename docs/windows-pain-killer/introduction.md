## Project Goal

No more Googling “how to fix Windows update stuck” or “Explorer.exe not responding” just double-click a script and get your life back.

Perfect for:

- IT admins & support engineers.
- Power users setting up new PCs.
- Anyone who has ever screamed at their computer.

## Quick Start

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/CyberForgeEx/Windows-Pain-Killer.git
cd Windows-Pain-Killer
```

Then just navigate to any folder and **right-click → Run as administrator** on any `.bat` file.

Or run from elevated Command Prompt/PowerShell:
```cmd
cd Daily-Annoyances
Restart-Explorer.bat
```

Done. Problem solved.

## Safety & Best Practices

- Every script is heavily commented and readable.
- Most scripts are non-destructive (but always read before running!)
