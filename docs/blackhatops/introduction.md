# BlackHatOps  
**BlackHat Operations – Offensive C Programs**

A curated collection of clean, heavily commented C programs covering core offensive security techniques like sockets, reverse shells, shellcode execution, process injection and more. Built exclusively for offensive security research, education, and authorized red team operations.

## Project Goal

Deliver clear, progressive, and production-quality C examples so learners and practitioners can:

- Master raw socket programming and network communication.
- Understand and build reliable reverse/bind shells.
- Safely test and execute custom shellcode.
- Learn real-world process injection and code injection techniques.
- Grasp offensive security primitives used in modern exploits and red team tooling.

All code is educational and intended **only** for authorized penetration testing, security research, and learning in legal environments.
